# Sacker: Expense Manager

**Sacker: Expense Manager** is an application designed to help users track their expenses efficiently. Users can add the amount spent, select a category, and provide an optional description for each expense. The app then sums up these expenses and provides a summary of daily spending. Additionally, it offers a fun comparison, showing how many Red Bulls one could have bought with the money spent or the percentage of an iPhone 15 equivalent to the day's expenses.

## Features

- **Daily Expense Summary:** Quickly see how much you've spent each day.
- **Expense Comparison:** Visualize your spending in terms of fun metrics like the number of Red Bulls or a fraction of an iPhone 15.
- **Time-Based Tabs:** Using cron technology, the app provides four tabs that display your spending over different periods:
  - Daily
  - Weekly
  - Monthly
  - Yearly
- **Currency Support:** The application supports PLN, EUR, and USD, and automatically converts expenses to these currencies for comparison purposes (e.g., number of Red Bulls, percentage of an iPhone 15). Currently, the currency setting is fixed to PLN, and the option to switch currencies will be available in a future update.
 
## Technologies Used
