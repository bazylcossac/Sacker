# Sacker: Expense Manager

**Sacker: Expense Manager** is an application designed to help users track their expenses efficiently. Users can add the amount spent, select a category, and provide an optional description for each expense. The app then sums up these expenses and provides a summary of daily spending. Additionally, it offers a fun comparison, showing how many Red Bulls one could have bought with the money spent or the percentage of an iPhone 15 equivalent to the day's expenses.

## Features

- **Daily Expense Summary:** Quickly see how much you've spent each day.
- **Expense Comparison:** Visualize your spending in terms of fun metrics like the number of Red Bulls or a fraction of an iPhone 15.
- **Time-Based Tabs:** Using cron technology, the app provides four tabs that display your spending over different periods:
  - Daily
  - Weekly
  - Monthly
  - Yearly

## Technologies Used

- **Vite:** Fast and modern build tool.
- **TypeScript:** Typed JavaScript for safer and scalable code.
- **TailwindCSS:** Utility-first CSS framework.
- **TailwindCSS Animated:** For smooth animations.
- **cron:** Scheduling library for running tasks at specified intervals.
- **D3.js:** JavaScript library for producing dynamic, interactive data visualizations.
- **Firebase:** Backend as a service providing authentication and database.

## Authentication

Users can log in using their Google account, a created account or they can create one

## Future Plans

I plan to release the application on Google Play and am actively working towards this goal.

## Note

This application is designed exclusively for mobile use.
